			<p>Leaders vary in their tactics - some mostly wield weapons or spells and only occasionally bark orders, while others spend a majority of time in combat simply observing, moving, and communicating with their allies to win.</p>
			<p class="indent">The leader prestige class is nonmagical and its secrets are usually learned upon the fields of battle or through natural talent. The abilities gained by being a leader are almost all useless without allies to command and support. This is what it means to be a leader - to rely on others who all rely on you.</p>
			<h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
			<p>In order to advance as a leader, you must meet the following prerequisites (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for your existing class):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Wisdom, Charisma or Intelligence 13.</b>A good leader
requires at least good planning, vision, or talent.</li>
				<li><b>Wisdom and Charisma 11.</b> Those who cannot
understand and influence others cannot be a leader.</li>
				<li><b>Proficiency in a Leadership skill.</b>You must have
proficiency in at least one of Animal Handling, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Religion, Performance, or Persuasion to gain levels as a leader</li>
				<li><b>Character level 5th.</b>Without a certain level of experience
under your belt, you will have a hard time leading your allies to victory and gaining the respect of your peers.</li>
				<li><b>Must command others.</b> The two main ways to achieve this are to either lead or head an organization of at least five people or to have changed an NPC's alignment to your own, but you may discuss with your DM whether you can fulfill other criteria to meet this important prerequisite.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a leader, you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
			<p>
				<span class="emphasis">Hit Dice:</span>1d8 per leader level<br/>
				<span class="emphasis">Hit Points per Level:</span>1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per leader level<br/>
			</p>
			<h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
			<p>
				<span class="emphasis">Tools:</span>None<br/>
				<span class="emphasis">Saving Throws:</span>None<br/>
				<span class="emphasis">Skills:</span>Insight, Intimidation,
Investigation, or Persuasion<br/>
			</p>
			<h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>The leader prestige class does not grant any special equipment.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you gain access to abilities called Stratagems. You learn 2 Stratagems of your choice from the list on pages 4 and 5 immediately when you reach 1st leveL and learn additional Stratagems of your choice from the list as you gain levels in this prestige class. When you gain a level in this prestige class, you may choose one Stratagem that you know and replace it with a different one. Stratagems are not magical and cannot be counterspelled or dispelled. They can be used at-will at any time, and do not have a limited number of uses. You can only use Stratagems that you know.</p>
			<p class="indent">All stratagems describe affecting an "ally" or "allies." Stratagems can only affect allied creatures as an "ally" target if they meet all of the following conditions:
